Imagine this, you actually got a girl! But guess what time of the month it is… Mother nature is calling, and she has become, quite frankly, terrifying! However, this isn’t your first rodeo. You know exactly what she needs. You must run around the mansions 10 rooms and find 8 items. You can move North, South, East, West – depending on current room. The rooms you will need to navigate: The Ballroom (starting location), Game room, Lavatory, Cat room, Bedroom, Library, Basement, PC room, Kitchen, Wine cellar. The items: Candy, Chocolate, Potato Chips, Hygiene products, Roses, Handwritten Card, Wine, Cat. Once you have found all the items, you can present them to her, and she will be so thankful! But beware, you don’t know what room she is in! If you don’t collect everything she needs before seeing her, it’s going to be a big fight and you will end up defeated and in the doghouse. 

This was a fun project that allowed us to demonstrate our innovation and imagination.
